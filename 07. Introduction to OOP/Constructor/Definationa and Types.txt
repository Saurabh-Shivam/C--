A constructor in C++ is a special member function within a class that gets automatically called when an object of that class is created. The primary purpose of a constructor is to initialize the object's data members, allocate any necessary resources, and set up the object's initial state.

Here's a concise definition of a constructor:

A constructor in C++ is a member function of a class that:
1. Has the same name as the class itself.
2. Does not have a return type, not even `void`.
3. Gets automatically invoked when an object of the class is created.
4. Is used to initialize the object's data members and perform any necessary setup during object creation.

Constructors play a vital role in object-oriented programming as they ensure that objects are properly initialized before they are used, which helps in maintaining the object's integrity and ensuring its correct behavior throughout its lifetime. Constructors can be overloaded, allowing you to define multiple constructors with different parameter lists to provide flexibility when creating objects of a class.


In C++, constructors can be categorized into several types based on their characteristics and how they are used:

    1. Default Constructor:
        A constructor with no parameters.
        Automatically generated by the compiler if no constructor is explicitly defined.
        Initializes the object's members to their default values (e.g., 0 for integers, nullptr for pointers).

    2. Parameterized Constructor:
        A constructor that accepts one or more parameters.
        Used to initialize object members with specific values at the time of object creation.

    3. Copy Constructor:
        A constructor used for creating a new object as a copy of an existing object of the same class.
        Invoked when an object is initialized with another object of the same type or passed by value.
